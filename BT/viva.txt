1. What is Ethereum?

Ans:
Ethereum is a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts — programs that run exactly as coded without any third party.

2. What is Solidity?

Ans:
Solidity is a programming language used to write smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

3. What is Gas in Ethereum?

Ans:
Gas is the unit of computational cost for executing transactions or smart contracts on the blockchain.
You pay gas in ETH as a transaction fee.

4. What is a Wallet Address?

Ans:
It is a unique identifier for each user on the blockchain, used to send or receive Ether and interact with contracts.

5. What is MetaMask used for?

Ans:
MetaMask is a crypto wallet and browser extension that connects your web app or Remix IDE to the Ethereum network and signs transactions.

6. What is a Test Network (Testnet)?

Ans:
A testnet is a network used for testing smart contracts using fake ETH, without spending real money.
Examples: Sepolia, Goerli.

7. What is the difference between Mainnet and Testnet?
Mainnet	Testnet
Uses real Ether (has real value)	Uses fake Ether (no real value)
Used for real-world deployment	Used for testing and learning
Permanent blockchain	Can be reset or changed easily
8. What is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)?

Ans:
EVM is the runtime environment that executes smart contracts on all Ethereum nodes.
It ensures that the same code runs identically everywhere.

9. What is the purpose of require() statement in Solidity?

Ans:
require() is used to check conditions before executing code.
If the condition fails, it reverts the transaction and returns unused gas.

10. What is the difference between view and pure functions?
Type	Meaning	Gas Usage
view	Reads blockchain data but doesn’t modify it	No gas when called externally
pure	Doesn’t read or modify blockchain data	No gas when called externally
11. What is mapping in Solidity?

Ans:
A mapping is a key-value store used to associate one type of data with another, e.g.
mapping(address => uint) balances;

12. What is a Struct in Solidity?

Ans:
A struct is a custom data type that groups multiple variables under one name (like a record).
Example: struct Student { uint roll; string name; uint marks; }

13. What is ABI (Application Binary Interface)?

Ans:
ABI defines how data and functions are encoded/decoded so external applications (like MetaMask or Web3.js) can interact with the smart contract.

14. What is a Transaction Hash?

Ans:
It is a unique identifier (like a receipt) for a blockchain transaction, used to track it on explorers like Etherscan.

15. What is the use of Remix IDE?

Ans:
Remix IDE is an online tool for writing, compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts easily without setting up any local environment.

16. What is the role of Node.js in Smart Contracts?

Ans:
Node.js allows developers to run deployment scripts, interact programmatically with contracts, and connect blockchain APIs using libraries like Web3.js or Ethers.js.

17. What happens when a transaction fails in Ethereum?

Ans:
If a transaction fails (like due to failed require()), the state is reverted, but gas fee is still consumed because computation was attempted.

18. What is a Faucet in blockchain?

Ans:
A faucet is a website that gives free test Ether for trying smart contracts on test networks.

19. What is the use of public and private in Solidity?

Ans:
They are visibility specifiers that control whether a variable or function can be accessed outside the contract.

20. What is the importance of Gas Fee Observation in BT-2?

Ans:
Observing gas helps understand how different operations consume computational resources, helping in optimizing smart contracts for real deployment.





## 🧾 **Assignment BT-1: Smart Contract for Bank Account**

### **Q1. What is the aim of this assignment?**

**Ans:**
The aim is to write and deploy a **smart contract on a test network** that allows a customer to:

* Deposit money
* Withdraw money
* Check balance

It demonstrates how smart contracts can simulate simple **banking operations** on the **Ethereum blockchain**.

---

### **Q2. Which programming language is used to write smart contracts?**

**Ans:**
We use **Solidity**, which is the most popular language for developing **Ethereum-based smart contracts**.

---

### **Q3. What are the main functions in your bank smart contract?**

**Ans:**

1. **deposit()** → Adds money to the customer’s balance.
2. **withdraw()** → Allows the customer to withdraw if sufficient balance exists.
3. **getBalance()** → Returns the current balance of the customer.

---

### **Q4. How is the balance stored in the contract?**

**Ans:**
The balance is stored in a **state variable** (for example, `mapping(address => uint) balance;`) that keeps track of each user’s balance using their wallet address.

---

### **Q5. What happens if a user tries to withdraw more than their balance?**

**Ans:**
The smart contract checks the balance before withdrawal using a condition like:

```solidity
require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
```

If the condition fails, the transaction is **reverted** and **gas fee is still consumed**.

---

### **Q6. What is the advantage of implementing a bank on blockchain?**

**Ans:**

* No need for third-party banks.
* Fully transparent and traceable transactions.
* High security (immutable records).
* Works automatically through smart contracts.

---

### **Q7. On which network did you deploy your contract?**

**Ans:**
I deployed it on the **Sepolia Test Network** using **MetaMask** and **Remix IDE / Hardhat**.
It uses **test ETH** for transactions.

---

### **Q8. How do you test your contract functions?**

**Ans:**
By calling the functions (deposit, withdraw, getBalance) from **Remix IDE**, confirming each transaction through **MetaMask**, and observing the **transaction hash** and **gas used**.

---

### **Q9. What is Gas in Ethereum?**

**Ans:**
Gas is the **fee paid to miners** for executing transactions or running smart contract operations on the Ethereum network. It prevents network abuse and compensates miners for computation.

---

### **Q10. What did you observe about gas consumption for each operation?**

**Ans:**

* **Deposit:** Low gas cost (simple addition).
* **Withdraw:** Slightly higher due to transfer logic.
* **Show Balance:** Least gas, as it’s a view (read-only) function.

## 🎓 **Assignment BT-2: Student Data Management Smart Contract**

### **Q1. What is the aim of this assignment?**

**Ans:**
The aim is to write a **Solidity program** that stores **student information** using **structures** and **arrays**, and then deploy it as a **smart contract** on the Ethereum test network.

---

### **Q2. What Solidity features did you use in this program?**

**Ans:**
I used:

* **Structure (struct):** To define student data like name, roll number, and marks.
* **Array:** To store multiple student records.
* **Functions:** To add and view student data.

---

### **Q3. Write the structure used for student data.**

**Ans:**

```solidity
struct Student {
    uint rollNo;
    string name;
    uint marks;
}
```

---

### **Q4. How did you store multiple student records?**

**Ans:**
By creating an **array of structures**:

```solidity
Student[] public students;
```

Then using a function like `addStudent()` to insert new records.

---

### **Q5. How do you retrieve a specific student’s data?**

**Ans:**
By writing a **view function** that returns data from the array based on index or roll number, for example:

```solidity
function getStudent(uint index) public view returns (Student memory) {
    return students[index];
}
```

---

### **Q6. Why do we deploy this contract on a test network?**

**Ans:**
To **experiment safely** with smart contracts without spending real Ether.
Test networks like **Sepolia** or **Goerli** provide **free test ETH** through faucets for development.

---

### **Q7. How do you check transaction fee and gas usage in Remix IDE?**

**Ans:**
After executing a transaction in Remix, you can check:

* **Gas used**
* **Transaction cost (in ETH)**
* **Execution cost**
  All are shown in the **transaction details section**.

---

### **Q8. What did you observe about the gas value for adding and viewing students?**

**Ans:**

* **Adding Student (write operation):** Consumes more gas because it changes blockchain state.
* **Viewing Student (read operation):** Uses almost no gas since it only reads data.

---

### **Q9. What are benefits of using structures in Solidity?**

**Ans:**

* Allows grouping related data (like name, roll, marks).
* Makes contract easier to understand and maintain.
* Enables creation of complex data models inside the contract.

---

### **Q10. What are the practical uses of this Student Data contract?**

### **1. What is a Smart Contract?**

**Definition:**
A **smart contract** is a **self-executing program** stored on a **blockchain** that automatically executes and enforces rules or agreements when certain predefined conditions are met.

**Detailed Explanation:**

* It is similar to a **digital agreement** written in code instead of paper.
* Once deployed on a blockchain (like Ethereum), it **runs automatically** without any third-party interference.
* The terms of the agreement are directly written into lines of code.
* It ensures **trust**, **transparency**, and **security** because once deployed, the code **cannot be altered**.

**Example:**
Let’s say you write a smart contract for selling an NFT.

* Condition: When a buyer sends 1 ETH,
* Action: The smart contract automatically transfers the NFT to the buyer.

You don’t need a middleman — the blockchain handles it.

**Key Features:**

* **Immutable:** Once deployed, code cannot be changed.
* **Transparent:** Everyone can verify the code and transaction.
* **Autonomous:** Executes automatically when conditions are met.
* **Secure:** Based on cryptographic blockchain security.

---

### **2. Explain use of MetaMask for Smart Contracts.**

**Definition:**
**MetaMask** is a **crypto wallet** and **gateway to blockchain applications**.
It allows users to **interact with Ethereum-based smart contracts** directly from their browser.

**Use in Smart Contracts:**

* MetaMask connects your **web application (frontend)** with the **Ethereum blockchain**.
* It manages **your Ethereum account**, **private keys**, and **transactions** securely.
* When deploying or interacting with a smart contract, MetaMask:

  1. **Signs** transactions using your wallet address.
  2. **Sends** transactions to blockchain nodes.
  3. **Pays** gas fees automatically.

**Steps for Use:**

1. Install MetaMask (browser extension or mobile app).
2. Create or import a wallet.
3. Connect MetaMask with your dApp (Decentralized App).
4. When the app calls a smart contract, MetaMask prompts for approval.
5. After approval, MetaMask broadcasts the transaction to the blockchain network (mainnet or testnet).

**Example:**
When you click “Deploy Smart Contract” in your app, MetaMask pops up asking for confirmation and gas fee → once confirmed, the contract is deployed to blockchain.

---

### **3. Write down steps for creating Node application for smart contracts deployment.**

Here we are using **Node.js + Hardhat** or **Truffle** for smart contract deployment.

**Steps (Generalized Process):**

1. **Install Node.js and npm**

   * Node.js helps to run JavaScript outside browser.
   * `npm` (Node Package Manager) installs required blockchain tools.

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Create Project Folder**

   ```bash
   mkdir smart-contract-demo
   cd smart-contract-demo
   ```

3. **Initialize Node Project**

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install Hardhat or Truffle**

   * Hardhat is a popular Ethereum development framework.

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   npx hardhat
   ```

5. **Write Smart Contract**

   * Create a file in `/contracts` folder (e.g., `SimpleStorage.sol`)
   * Example:

     ```solidity
     // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
     pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

     contract SimpleStorage {
         uint public data;
         function set(uint _data) public {
             data = _data;
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Compile the Contract**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

7. **Deploy Script**

   * Create a deploy script in `/scripts/deploy.js`

   ```javascript
   const hre = require("hardhat");
   async function main() {
     const Storage = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleStorage");
     const storage = await Storage.deploy();
     await storage.waitForDeployment();
     console.log("Contract deployed at:", await storage.getAddress());
   }
   main();
   ```

8. **Run Deployment on Test Network**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

9. **Connect MetaMask**

   * Use same test network (e.g., Sepolia) and wallet address from MetaMask to view deployed contract.

---

### **4. Explain concept of Test Network and provide its types.**

**Definition:**
A **test network (testnet)** is a **blockchain network used for testing** smart contracts or decentralized apps before deploying them to the **main network (mainnet)**.

**Purpose:**

* To experiment with contracts **without spending real money**.
* To **debug and verify** logic before real-world deployment.
* To simulate how transactions will behave on mainnet.

**How it Works:**

* Testnets use **test tokens** (e.g., test ETH) that have **no real-world value**.
* You can get free test tokens from **faucets**.
* The structure and rules are the same as the mainnet, but separate.

**Types of Ethereum Test Networks:**

1. **Sepolia Testnet** → Modern official Ethereum testnet (widely used).
2. **Goerli Testnet** → Previously popular, now deprecated in 2025.
3. **Rinkeby Testnet** → Older network, replaced by Sepolia.
4. **Local Testnet** → Created using tools like Hardhat or Ganache for local testing.

**Example:**
If you want to test your contract deployment, you can deploy it on **Sepolia** using fake ETH from a faucet → verify the contract on Etherscan testnet → then deploy on **Ethereum Mainnet** once confirmed working.
